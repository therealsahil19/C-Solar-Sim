# Scribe's Journal - Solar System Simulation ✍️

Documentation standards and coverage logs.

## Standards
- **Language:** English (US)
- **Code Comments:** Doxygen-style (using `@brief`, `@param`, `@returns`).
- **Markdown:** GFM with clear headers and tables.
- **Terminology:**
  - Use **AU** for Astronomical Units.
  - Use **Solar Masses** for mass.
  - Use **Body** for celestial objects.

## Coverage Gaps
- `PhysicsEngine.hpp`: Complex algorithms (RK4, Barnes-Hut) need math explanations.
- `README.md`: Needs troubleshooting and clear Windows build path.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: Missing entirely.

## Log

## 2026-01-05 - [Docs Update]
**Focus:** Infrastructure & Core Physics
**Standard:** Doxygen for C++ headers.
**Gap:** GUI Engine components still need detailed property documentation.

## 2026-01-06 - [Docs Update]
**Focus:** Project-wide Literacy & Maintenance
**Standard:** GFM README, Doxygen Headers (Math-heavy).
**Gap:** Octree and Shader internals could use deeper logic flow documentation.

## 2026-01-07 - [Docs Update] **Scribe: Technical Literacy Overhaul** ✍️
**Focus:** Physics, Graphics Bridge, and Memory Pooling.
**Standard:** Doxygen with LaTeX formulas for physics; "Scaling Bridge" definition for graphics.
**Gap:** GUI Engine transition animations and input handling details are still sparse.

## 2026-01-07 - [Docs Update] **Scribe: Core Literacy & Mathematical Foundations** ✍️
**Focus:** Unit systems, Integrator math (RK4/Verlet), and Scaling Bridge philosophy.
**Standard:** Detailed "Why over What" documentation in headers. Added Math section to README.
**Gap:** Shader internals (GLSL) and texture mapping logic could use more detail.
