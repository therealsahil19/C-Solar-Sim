2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style (we use Doxygen for comments).

## Documentation Standards
As **Scribe** says: "If it isn't documented, it doesn't exist."
- Use TSDoc/JSDoc style for headers.
- Explain the **Why**, not just the **What**.
- Include math references for physics changes.

## Development Setup
Check the `README.md` for build instructions. We recommend using Visual Studio 2022 on Windows or GCC/Clang on Linux.
